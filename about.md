_Hey there! My name's Darren Thompson and thanks for visiting my little corner of the internet!_

I am a full stack software developer by trade living in Toronto, Canada. I'm currently working on cool tech for sports fans [@theScore](https://twitter.com/theScore).

I am skilled in all things Javascript, and I love working with ReactJS, Elixir/Pheonix and Rust. Constantly on a mission to learn new things and explore out of my comfort zone. I have many interests, some being Functional Programming, UX, [Making/Hacking (in the constructive sense)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace), Embedded Systems, and Games.

Follow me on twitter [@DiscoStarslayer](https://twitter.com/DiscoStarslayer). I've also got a [GitHub](https://github.com/DiscoStarslayer) page with some of my projects.

Have any questions or comments? Reach out to my Twitter inbox or send me an [E-Mail](mailto:me@dtho.mp)!
